1. Compare two numbers and check whether they are equal or not. If the numbers are equal print “Y”
else print “N”.
2. Ask user to enter a number and check whether number is Even or odd.
3. Convert this C++ code to assembly.
if( var1 == var2 )
var3 = 10;
else
{
var3 = 6;
var4 = 7; }
4. Write an Assembly program to print all the Odd numbers from 1 to 9 using Compare instructions.
5. Write an assembly language program that take input(obtained marks) from user and display the grade
of that subject.
If greater than 8  grade = A
If greater than 7  grade = A-
If greater than 6  grade = B+
If greater than 5  grade = B
If greater than 4  grade = B-
If greater than 3  grade = C+
else fail
