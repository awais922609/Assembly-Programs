# Assembly Programs #
Welcome to my repository of Assembly Programs! These programs were developed during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and are now available for public use. They include a variety of programs for different purposes, from simple arithmetic operations to more complex algorithms.

# Usage
To use any of these programs, simply download the source code and assemble it using an appropriate assembler of masm as they are masm compatible not nasm.
Uncomment each present code 1 present in files 1 at a time to see its desired output.
#### Download AssmSoft folder and extract it.
#### Place your code in that folder. Open Dosbox. Mount that folder using mount c /location/to/AssmSoft_Folder.
#### Then load Dosbox memory by typing (c:) on dosbox.

# How to Assemble and Run
#### masm filename.asm
#### link filename.obj
#### filename.exe
If you want to debug your code then instead of filename.exe use:
### afd filename.exe
AFD is Advance Free Debugger which is used for understanding how Code is being saved in Memory and then being utilised.

# Learn 
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Muhammad Nouman from Fast Peshawar, who inspired me to create this repository. If you're interested in learning more about Assembly Language and how these codes work, I highly recommend checking out his channel at **https://shorturl.at/iHZ01**. It's a great resource for anyone looking to expand their knowledge and skills in this area.

# Contributions
Contributions to this repository are always welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with your own programs or improvements to existing ones. Together, we can build a comprehensive library of assembly programs for everyone to use.
