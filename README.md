# Assembly Programs #
Welcome to my repository of Assembly Programs! These programs were developed during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and are now available for public use. They include a variety of programs for different purposes, from simple arithmetic operations to more complex algorithms.

# Usage
To use any of these programs, simply download the source code and assemble it using an appropriate assembler of masm as they are masm compatible not nasm.
Uncomment each present code 1 present in files 1 at a time to see its desired output.

# How to Assembly and Run
#### masm filename.asm
#### link filename.obj
#### filename.exe

# Contributions
Contributions to this repository are always welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with your own programs or improvements to existing ones. Together, we can build a comprehensive library of assembly programs for everyone to use.
